# Know-your-Subscriber
In this project, I created a simple subscription page with the help of mailchimp api. 
If someone write his/her firstname, lastname and email then after clicking on the submit button, It will redirect on success page which means the person is added in 
your audience.
If you made your mailchimp account then you can see them on your audience list.
